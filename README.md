# Intro:

- This page contains links to source code that demonstrate my ability to complete a project in varying areas of computer science.
- Each project will be accompanied by a narrative explaining what the project is and why I included it in this site.
- In addition to the narratives, I have included a code review I conducted on each of the projects before enhancing them and adding them to the site.
- To begin, please click the link below in order to read a self-assessment of my experience with Southern New Hampshire University's computer science degree program.
