# Hi, I'm Olivier. Welcome to my ePortfolio.

## ePortfolio Intro:

- This page contains links to projects that demonstrate my ability to complete a project in varying areas of computer science.
- Each project will be accompanied by a narrative explaining what the project is and why I included it in this site.
- In addition to the narratives, I have included a code review I conducted on each of the projects before enhancing them and adding them to the site.

## Code Review:   

Use this [Code Review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jcxPzzgW1I_U4lcVBmadQemr-_02WJ9y/view?usp=sharing) link in order to view my comprehensive video analysis of the projects below.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Olivier-504/portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Olivier-504/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
